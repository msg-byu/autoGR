# Revision History

## Revision 0.2.2 (WSM)
- Fixed bugs in rhombohedral 24 and rhombohedral 9, the former works
  correctly now and the latter had an incoorect basis, it now runs on
  about the same time scale as rhombehdral 2 and 4.
- Added contitions to rhombohedral_2_4 to make it faster.
- Added function to find the symmetry preserving HNFs for both of the
  hexagonal niggli cells.
- Added the second simple tetragonal niggli basis.

## Revision 0.2.1 (WSM)
- Added tolerances to all comparisons in the niggli identification
  script.
- Added tolerances to all comparsions made in the niggli condition
  checking code.
- Added functions to find the symmetry preserving HNFs for all 4
  niggli rhombohedral cells (rhombohedral 24 is wrong though and
  rhombohedral 9 is painfully slow, rhombohedral 2_4 is about 20 times
  slower than the standard trigonal approach).


## Revision 0.2.0 (WSM)
- Added python niggli reduction code and identification script (still
  needs unit testing).

## Revision 0.1.6 (WSM)
-Added second algorithm for generating the body centered tetragonal
 HNFs.
-Added new output to lat_type that may help the basis
 transformation. It now also outputs the order of the basis vectors
 according to size.
-Fixed bug reported in [issue #4](https://github.com/msg-byu/opf_kgrids/issues/4).
-Added a new text file where I'm writing the comparison between methods section.
-Fixed and updated a number of unit tests.

## Revision 0.1.5 (JJ)
- Renamed unit test test_jeremy.py test_sym_grids.py.
- Fixed remaining import calls.

## Revision 0.1.4 (JJ)
- Fixed import calls in a few modules but some are still missing.
- Renamed jeremy.py sym_grids.py.
- Added latex code for the paper we will submit in the directory named
  paper. Completed rough draft of introduction.
- Added notebooks which will test our symmetry preserving grids on
  empirical pseudopotentials in python (must have BZI to run tests).
- Started tests on empirical pseudopotentials in a notebook called
  Search for Figure of Merit.

## Revision 0.1.3
- Fixed a bug in the python code concerning commencerate lattices.

## Revision 0.1.2
- Updated the driver to print the k-points in reciprocal lattice
  coordinates instead of cartesian. Still needs to be tested to see if
  VASP reads it in properly.

## Revision 0.1.1
- Fixed the first few bugs in the make KPOINTS file routine.

## Revision 0.1.0
- Made a driver that makes a kpoints file from the POSCAR and a file
  containing the desired k-point density and offset.
- Implemented the rest of the code needed to find the optimal k_grid.

## Revision 0.0.14
- Added remaining crystal classes to sp_hnf.f90.
- Added unit tests for all crystal classes.

## Revision 0.0.13
- Added hex, trigonal, simple tetragonal and body centered tetragonal
  cases to sp_hnf.f90.

## 0.0.12
- Began implementing the fortran version of the code (created sc, bcc,
  and fcc subroutines).

## 0.0.11
- Implemented faster algorithms for bcc, fcc, sc, and body centered tetragonal cells.
- Fixed integer division in universal.py for python 3.
- Fixed a bug in lat_type.py that was caused by the appearance of
  negative angles from the dot products.
- Fixed jeremey.py. The loop over the grids was indented to far.

## 0.0.10
- Fixed bugs in jeremy.py and in universal.py.
- Added some new unit tests to check for the bugs.
- Added additional supporting info.

## 0.0.9
- Created driver for grid generation src/opf_python/gengrid.py. The
  driver is still incomplete.
- Created new subroutines in universal.py. The first is to find the
  symmetry preserving grids given a lattice and target density. The
  second returns the volume factors that will be used for generating
  the srHNFs. Both subroutines still need work.
- Added number and time scaling plots for face centered cubic and face
  centered orthorhombic.
- Added a module for Jeremy's test to use, jeremy.py.

## 0.0.8
- Fixed some bugs in lat_type.py.
- Impltemented unit tests for lat_type.py

## 0.0.7
- Added python modules for each of the remaining lattice types to the
src/opf_python directory, as well as their unit tests (all modules
agree to with the brute force method for volumes factors of 1 to 500
in the tests except monoclinic lattices which have only been tested on
volumes of 1 to 150 for time reasons).
-Fixed error in notes/body_centered_ortho.nb.
-Added lat_type.py to repo. It's a module that identifies the lattice type.

## 0.0.6
- Added src/python/trig.py to the repo. It finds the srHNFs for the trigonal case.
- Fixed a logic error in the simple, body centered, and face centered
  cubic cases and added the math for the mathematica notebook in the notes for the
  each case.
- Added src/python/stet.py for the simple tetrogonal case as well as a
  mathematica notebook in the notes folder.
- Added a mathematica notebooks for all remaining lattices.
- Added the paper `Space Group Subgroups generated by Sublattice
  Relations` to the notes folder.
- Fixed an infinite loop in trig.py.
- Implemented unit tests on all existing python modules.

## 0.0.5
- Added the 'canonical' parent lattice to the documentation for each crystal class.
- Fixed bugs in the conditions for bcc and fcc. They now find HNFs at
  the correct volumes in the range (1-100).
- Added jupyter-notebook that shows how to identify the lattice type for the code.
- Added plots of the HNF and srHNF scaling the brute force way in
  addition to the notebook that generated the plots.

## 0.0.4
-Renamed the fcc and bcc subroutines so that they are called fcc and
 bcc. Also changed the comments to reflect that change.

## 0.0.3
- Added python code that handles the sc, bcc, and fcc lattices using
  Rod's divisor method.
- Also added an jupyter notebook that shows the timing for the
  generation of the grids for a single determinant at a time. It
  scales really nicely.

## 0.0.2
- Added the testing_codes dir. This directory contains the brute force
  fortran code that is being used to test how large of an volume
  factor we can generate the srHNFs in a given time is and to
  determine which volumes matter mast.
- Added the src directory which will contain code designed for future
  distribution.
- Added the nots directory in which we can store notes from
  collaborations. For now I'm including Rod's divisors writeup and the
  history of or dialog with Dr. Campbell.
