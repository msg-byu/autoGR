Notes for optimal packing fraction k-point grids

# Notes

The notes folder contains records of ideas we've gathered from collaborations.

# Testing_codes

This directory contains the brute force fortran code that we're doing
tests with. These tests are to give us an idea of the time scales,
determine which volumes matter, and to provide unit tests latter.

# src

This directory holds the codes we will be developing for release to
the general public and implimentation in VASP.
